#CODE2040-API-Challenge

This is my repository to show the source code for my solutions to the [CODE2040 API Challenge](http://challenge.code2040.org/).  CODE2040 is an amazing organization that seeks to eliminate the racial gap in the tech workforce by 2040 (the year in which America will be a majority-minority).  It achieves this goal by offering black and latino/a students mentorship and guidance programs as well as help getting placement in tech internships.

My intentions are to solve the challenges in as many languages as I have time. I will make a folder for each language and then a seperate files for each solution. Within each file, I will solve the problem in a couple distinct ways (to show my versatility and usage of both core concepts as well as knowledge of the language) and will order them in terms of efficiency/spped.

Hopefully, I will also get around to making an interactive Web Page, where you can see the challenges visibly and my solutions to them.

Let the fun, erm challenge, begin!
