#CODE2040-API-Challenge

This is my repository to show the source code for my solutions to the [CODE2040 API Challenge](http://challenge.code2040.org/).  CODE2040 is an amazing organization that seeks to eliminate the racial gap in the tech workforce by 2040 (the year in which America will be a majority-minority).  It aims to achieve this goal by offering black and latino/a students mentorship and guidance programs as well as help getting placement in tech internships.

My intentions are to solve the challenges in as many languages as I have time. I will make a folder for each language and then a seperate files for each solution. Within each file, I will solve the problem in a couple distinct ways (to show my versatility and usage of both core concepts as well as knowledge of the language) and will order them in terms of efficiency/speed. I am trying to solve these without a lot of external libraries (because that would be tooo easy ;P), and rather just the core language.  The one exception to this, is that I used JQuery to set-up the webpage, because I think knowledge of JQuery.ajax is good to show off (source code found in gh-pages branch).

Currently the languages I have are:

1. Python - Complete
2. JavaScript - Complete
3. C - Complete - **Terminal Interface**
4. JQuery/[Webpage](http://andonigarcia.github.io/CODE2040-API-Challenge) - Complete - **Web Interface**
4. PHP - Complete

Hope you enjoy my solutions!
