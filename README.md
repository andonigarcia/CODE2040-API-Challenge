#CODE2040-API-Challenge

This is my repository to show my source code for my solutions to the [CODE2040 API Challenge](http://challenge.code2040.org/).  CODE2040 is an amazing organization that seeks to eliminate the racial gap in the tech workforce by 2040 (the year in which America will be a majority-minority).  It does this by offering black and latino/a students mentorship and help getting placement in the tech arena.

My intentions are to solve the challenges in as many languages as I have time. I will make a folder for each language and then a seperate file for each solution. Hopefully, I get around to making an interactive Web Page, where you can see the challenges visibly and my solutions to them.

Let the fun, erm challenge, begin!
